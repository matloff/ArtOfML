Hi, everyone.  Norm Matloff of UC Davis here, author of this book.  I do
research, teach and write in computer science and statistics ([see my
Bio](https://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/matloff.html)).  I've written a
number of books, including an award-winning one, but I've found writing
this one to be especially gratifying.

## Why I wrote this book

* There was a need for a book that *uses* the R language but
is not *about* R.  This is a book on ML that happens to *use R for
examples*, not a book about *the use of R in ML*.

* There is a need for an ML book that recognizes that *ML is
an art, not a science.* (Hence the title of this book.)  No flow
charts or the like here.

* One does not have to be a math whiz or know advanced math in order
to use ML effectively, but *one does need to understand the
concepts well --- the Why? and How? of ML methods.*
